# LLM
What I am doing is going through the various modules Karpathy wrote and am working on converting each individual module to RTL. 

I am creating separate files for each one and then plan on having a top level main file that instantiates all of the modules created 

I have also added Karpathy's run.c file for reference 

Surendra - if you have time and are able to write out your ideas for the softmax module so I can use that as an idea moving forward that'd be great. Thanks!
